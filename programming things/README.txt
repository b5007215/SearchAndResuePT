In this folder I will enclose a more detailed report.

Main achievements:

Zumo works with W,A,S,D and stop controls with the use of Xbees.

When the zumo goes into  a wall thats on the side of the corridor then the zumos path is adjusted.

When the zumo hits a wall head on, the zumo comes to a stop and requests for user asistance.

Corridor and room numbers are identified.

The zumo begins by calibrating to the enviroment, NOT by inputting constant values as the QTR threshold
